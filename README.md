This repository contains a demonstration of a common bug in Dapps: incorrectly retrieving a user's balance.  The `getBalanceBug.js` file shows the erroneous code, while `getBalanceSolution.js` provides the correct implementation.  The bug arises from assuming the contract's Ether balance reflects the user's balance; instead, it's necessary to query the user's balance using their address.
